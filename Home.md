This wiki is a guide to contributing to MongoDB Server. For help with MongoDB Server see the links in **Other Resources**.

The MongoDB Server is written in C++ with an extensive suite of tests in JavaScript. To get started with the server, you will want to see [Building with Server](Build-Mongodb-From-Source). For help with the tools, see [Building the Tools](Build-Tools-From-Source) or http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools. If you are looking to instead get started with drivers that connect to the server, check out our list of [official drivers](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/) for more information.

To get started with making your first contribution, see [choosing a project](Choose-A-Project). After that, we have guides on the code format and style guidelines we use in the server. Once you finish writing your code, we have documentation to help you test and verify your change.
